Oct. 26, Sidestrafe: 

 -METEOR: CFG cleaned up, Guidance law upgraded to Loft-Pronav, flight model preliminary buff to something nearing AMRAAM standard.
 -COMET/ASRAAM: FM and seeker touched up to something nearing competent. Still underpowered. 
 -CUDA: Warhead made functional, radar guidance made functional, guidance law made functional.
 -JDAMER: Drag reduced from 85m^2 to a reasonable level. Guidance law changed to bomb guidance law instead of powered cruise missile. Testing required.
 -JDAM: Normalized aero model. 
 -SPHERE drag reduced to something a little bit closer to a glide bomb than a brick bomb, needs testing. 

 -57mm: Proximity fuze round in description now actually exists, likely a bit too strong atm. Accuracy changed to be more consistent with a naval gun expected to engage targets past 600m. (Comment PF round out of the cfg if for some reason you wanted the 57 to be worthless)
 -76mm, 40mm: Minor buff to accuracy and round potency.
 -127mm: Cargo round given a little bit of HE filler so it can pretend to be useful.
